<article class="article">
	<p>The Toronto Stock Evaluator provides real-time data analysis concerning the
    		Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
	<p>Use the "Search Ticker" page to search a stock ticker and retrieve a company's data.</p>
	<p>Searching tickers: The Evaluator has a search feature that allows the user to find the open, high, low, close, and volume 
   		metrics for any company's stocks, as well as the current price of the stock. To find a company's data, follow the steps below:</p>
	<ol>Enter the stock ticker of the company into the search bar (ex: AAPL for Apple) Note: This feature is case sensitive. 
   		You must enter the ticker in ALL CAPS.</ol>
	<ol>Be patient. Currently, our system does not use a cache or cookies so the data may take a while to load.</ol>
	<ol>The name of the corresponding company will appear, along with all six basic metrics. 
		These are calculated on a per-minute basis.</ol>

	<p>Useful financial definitions for terms used in the site:</p>
	<p>Short-sell: Short selling is the sale of an asset that is not owned by the seller or that the seller has borrowed. 
		Short selling is motivated by the belief that a security's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back at
		a lower price to make a profit.</p>
	<p>Blue-chip Stock: A blue-chip stock is the stock of a large, well-established and financially sound company that has 
		operated for many years. An example would be Microsoft.</p>
	<p>Relative Strength Index: A technical indicator that comes in the form of a quotient derived from comparing the magnitude 
		of recent gains and losses over a specified time period (we use 14 days) to measure speed and change of price
		movements of a stock. It is primarily used to identify if a stock is overbought (over-valued) or oversold 
		(under-valued).</p>
	<p>Moving Average: A technical indicator that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random price fluctuations.
		At each defined interval (we use a daily interval), the stock's average price over the last specified number of days is 
		calculated. This figure, and especially crossovers between moving averages, allow us to determine the trend of the stock's 
		growth.</p>
	<p>Spot Price: The current market price at which an asset is bought or sold for immediate payment and delivery.</p>
